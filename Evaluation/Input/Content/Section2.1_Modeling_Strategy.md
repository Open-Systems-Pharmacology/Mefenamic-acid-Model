The general concept of building a PBPK model has previously been described by Kuepfer *et al.* ([Kuepfer 2016](#5-references)). Relevant information on anthropometric (height, weight) and physiological parameters (e.g. blood flows, organ volumes, binding protein concentrations, hematocrit, cardiac output) in adults was gathered from the literature and has been previously published ([PK-Sim Ontogeny Database Version 7.3](#5-references)). The information was incorporated into PK-Sim速 and was used as default values for the simulations in adults.

The  applied activity and variability of plasma proteins and active processes that are integrated into PK-Sim速 are described in the publicly available PK-Sim速 Ontogeny Database Version 7.3 ([Schlender 2016](#5-references)) or otherwise referenced for the specific process.

A base mean model was built using clinical Phase I data including data from published single dose studies after oral application of mefenamic acid and data from an in-house clinical multiple-dose study to find an appropriate structure to describe the pharmacokinetics in plasma. The mean PBPK model was developed using a typical European individual. 

Unknown parameters (see below) were identified using the Parameter Identification module provided in PK-Sim速. Structural model selection was mainly guided by visual inspection of the resulting description of data and biological plausibility.

Finally, an *in vitro* in-house determined K<sub>i</sub> value of mefenamic acid on glucuronidation of propofol via UGT1A9 was applied to incorporate reversible UGT1A9 inhibition.

Details about input data (physicochemical, *in vitro* and clinical) can be found in [Section 2.2](#22-data).

Details about the structural model and its parameters can be found in [Section 2.3](#23-model-parameters-and-assumptions).
