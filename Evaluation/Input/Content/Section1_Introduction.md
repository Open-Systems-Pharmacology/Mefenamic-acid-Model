Mefenamic acid is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs). The mechanism of action of mefenamic acid, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2).

Mefenamic acid has been described to undergo metabolism by CYP2C9; it is also glucuronidated directly ([DrugBank DB00784](#5-References)).

Furthermore, mefenamic acid is known to be a potent inhibitor of uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase 1A9 (UGT1A9) and used in clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies as a perpetrator to investigate the DDI potential of potential UGT1A9 substrates.

The presented model building and evaluation report evaluates the performance of a PBPK model for mefenamic acid in adults.

The objective is to establish a whole-body PBPK model for mefenamic acid featuring:

* a description of the systemic plasma concentration of mefenamic acid after oral administration.
* reversible UGT1A9 inhibition. 

The presented model building and evaluation report evaluates the performance of the PBPK model for mefenamic acid in (healthy) adults.
