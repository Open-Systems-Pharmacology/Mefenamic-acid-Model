### 2.2.1 In vitro / physicochemical Data

A literature search was performed to collect available information on physicochemical properties of mefenamic acid. The obtained information from literature is summarized in the table below.

With regard to UGT1A9 inhibition, mefenamic acid inhibited propofol glucuronidation in recombinant UGT1A9 by a mixed-type mechanism, however close to a competitive type (*BAYER in-house*: [Jungmann 2019](#5-references)):

### 2.2.2 Clinical Data

A literature search was performed to collect available clinical data on mefenamic acid in adults. 

The following publications were found for adults and, unless noted otherwise, used for model building and evaluation:
