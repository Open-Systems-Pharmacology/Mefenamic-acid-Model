The PBPK model for mefenamic acid was developed. The model was evaluated covering data from studies including

* single and multiple doses
* a dose range of 250 to 500 mg
* fasted and fed administration.

The model does not quantify specific metabolic pathways of mefenamic acid as it was developed to be used in the context of UGT inhibition. UGT1A9 inhibition was implemented as a (reversible) mixed-type inhibition. Input values were directly incorporated from an in-house *in vitro* experiment.

The next sections show:

1. the final model parameters for the building blocks: [Section 3.1](#3.1-Final-Input-Parameters).
2. the overall goodness of fit: [Section 3.2](#3.2-Diagnostics-Plots).
   *Note that data from [Becker 2016](#5-References) are not shown for data confidentiality reasons.*
3. simulated vs. observed concentration-time profiles for the clinical studies used for model building and for model verification: [Section 3.3](#3.3-Concentration-Time-Profiles).
   *Note that data from [Becker 2016](#5-References) are not shown for data confidentiality reasons.*
